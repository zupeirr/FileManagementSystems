# FileManagementSystem Project Report

## 1. Introduction

**FileManagementSystem** is a Java-based command-line application designed for managing text files in a local directory. It serves as a practical demonstration of core file handling operations such as creating, reading, updating, deleting, listing, and searching files using Java. The project aims to help students understand essential file I/O concepts and basic user authentication.

## 2. Main Purpose and Goals

- Enable users to securely manage text files within a designated directory.
- Demonstrate file management operations in Java.
- Illustrate simple user authentication and role-based access (admin vs. client).

---

## 3. Key Features

### 3.1 User Authentication

- Hardcoded users with roles ("admin" or "client").
- Login functionality managed in `AuthService`.
- Incorrect login attempts provide informative error messages.
- Users are routed to role-specific interfaces after login.

### 3.2 File Management Operations

Implemented in the `FileService` class and accessible via the UI:

- **Create File:** Users can create new text files and add initial content.
- **View Files:** List all files stored in the directory.
- **Read File:** Display the content of a selected file.
- **Update File:** Append new content to existing files.
- **Delete File:** Remove files from the directory.

### 3.3 User Interface

- Command-line menus for admins and clients.
- Admins can perform all file operations, clients have limited access.
- "About" page describes the system and contributors.

## 4. Architecture Overview

- **Main.java**: Entry point; launches login flow.
- **ui/LoginPage.java**: Handles user login.
- **ui/AdminPage.java**: Admin interface for file operations.
- **ui/ClientPage.java**: Client interface for viewing/reading files.
- **service/FileService.java**: Implements file operation logic.
- **utils/AuthService.java**: Manages login/authentication.
- **model/User.java**: User data model.

## 6. Usage

- Run the application via `Main.java`.
- Login as either an admin or client (credentials are hardcoded).
- Navigate through command-line menus to perform file operations.

---

## 7. Conclusion

FileManagementSystem is a simple, educational Java project that demonstrates file handling and basic authentication. It is suitable for students and teams learning about backend concepts and command-line applications.
